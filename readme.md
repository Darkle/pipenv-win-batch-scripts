* This is a windows batch script to help with pipenv: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv

1. Put this file anywhere and add it to you path.
2. When in your python project folder, run `pvshell` and it will prepend your current prompt with `(pipenv shell)` and run pipenv shell internally
3. Using `exit` like normal will exit pipenv shell and change the prompt back to what it was before.
